# CGR-calc
Takes 6-month long .csv files from CleanMedia ad data and sorts it by month. 
It uses 2 files because of CleanMedia's strange file limits. The two files should be Jan-Jun and Jul-Dec data.
Make sure the .csv files are either saved in the same folder as the file OR input the file path when it prompts for the file name(s).
